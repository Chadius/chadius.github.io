    <h1>Anti goal: Boss DPR comparisons</h1>
    Many game communities try to choose the best squaddie, the best weapon, or the best item. Damage Over Round (or Second in
    real time games)
    tends to be the first tool they reach for. It's a relatively easy number to calculate, so it's often the first and
    only number.
    It winds up dominating the conversation, even when there are other comparisons.<br><br>


    <h2>Example: Fire Emblem</h2>
    Early on in Fire Emblem, units were ranked solely on their ease in killing bosses.
    <ul>
        <li> Movement speed was not considered. Some strong units were too slow to reach objectives quickly.
            "Weaker" units who could get there were eventually rated much better.
        </li>
        <li> Thieves were considered useless because they were bad at killing (unless they upgraded to assassins, and
            then they were cool.)
            Eventually people saw how useful stealing was, especially in games where the best tools are really
            expensive.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Because it was so easy to rate damage output, DPR blinded the community for a while.

    <h2>Example: Pathfinder 2nd Edition</h2>
    Spellcasting in general has been reigned in from the D&D versions. Some people think a bit too much, and often
    complain
    Wizards are too weak.
    <ul>
        <li>In D&D 3rd and 2014/5th edition, Wizards are extremely powerful and can hit harder than fighters and defend
            better than paladins. They can also keep their powerful spells.
        </li>
        <li>In Pathfinder 2e, martial characters are great at consistent single-target damage and have good defenses.
            Spellcasters lack both.
        </li>
        <li>Spells are a limited resource, and you can usually cast 3-4 spells per rank before needing overnight rest.
            Missing a sword swing means you can swing again. A spell missing means you lost a daily resource.
        </li>
        <li>Bosses have high armor and good resistances. High level bosses are more likely to dodge spells and resist
            the others.
        </li>
    </ul>

    There are a few counterpoints and alternatives:
    <ul>
        <li>Wizards get access to the entire arcane spell list. In exchange for this versatility, they cannot
            specialize. But this also means they can have the right spell for any job.
        </li>
        <li>Mobs and group battles let area of attacks shine. Spellcasters are much better than this, yet people focus
            solely on boss fights. Mob damage can add up quickly.
        </li>
        <li>Sorcerers choose their spells but are stuck with those spells throughout their career. They also choose a
            bloodline, granting additional spells and different spell lists. They can choose their favorite spells to
            specialize in and carry scrolls for emergencies.
        </li>
        <li>Magus characters have a limited arcane spell list, but they can wear armor and add spell damage to their
            weapon strikes. This allows them to specialize in a theme.
        </li>
        <li>Kineticists are not spellcasters, but they can fire an elemental blast every round, without limit. It is not
            as strong as attack spells, but it's reliable. A class feat allows them to use elemental themed magic from
            scrolls and wands if they choose.
        </li>
        <li>Recall Knowledge checks will often indicate the enemy's weakest resistance, allowing spellcasters to look
            for ways to exploit it. Wizards have a vast array of magic and are the best at exploiting this hole.
        </li>
        <li>Buffing your martials and debuffing the boss before using attack spells also works. Buffs always work.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My solution: Level Design</h2>
    <h3>Add timers/emphasize speed</h3>
    <p>X-COM 2's missions all use a timer. A data breach will be shut off at a data site soon, or a VIP was just
        captured
        and the vehicle will be untraceable soon, etc.
        Many of these timers felt artificial, though.</p>
    <p>Instead, put the objective on the map.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There was an Advance Wars mission where you had to launch all the rockets
            on the map, but you had to stop the enemies from reaching them first. You could rush ahead, or you could
            stop
            the enemies. No timer needed.
        </li>
        <li>Some Fire Emblem games offer bonus rewards for completing the mission quickly. Many have enemy thieves who
            will grab the treasure and then flee to the nearest exit. If you don't hurry, you lose the bonus goods. Then
            again it may not be worth the risk.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hazards</h3>
    <p>An alternative is to add hazards that must be disarmed, or a hazard that deals too much damage to bear. Non
        combat units could specialize in dealing with them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The area is haunted and attacks random squaddies. A priest could spend their time blessing the area.</li>
        <li>A wall blocks the way, but a switch will lower them if someone can figure out how to use it.</li>
        <li>Sandpits swallow everyone who approaches, but some nature survival experts can quickly slow down and stop
            the holes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Mobs</h3>
    <p>Multiple weak enemies can emphasize squaddies with Area of Effect attacks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In Pathfinder 2e, enemies at your level - 4 are considered trivial. But they do get a hit in every once in a
            while, and they block the martials from getting to the boss. An area of effect can quickly clear them area.
        </li>
        <li>Later Fire Emblem games give everyone a free counterattack. Sometimes your boss killer kills too quickly and
            dies because they keep killing the blockers and inviting more attackers to arrive. Sometimes you want a tank
            to block the chokepoint instead.
        </li>
    </ul>
