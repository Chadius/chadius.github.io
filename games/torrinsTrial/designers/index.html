    <h2>Computer Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid technology requirements.</li>
        <li>This needs to run on a variety of platforms.</li>
        <li>I don't want to force installation processes.</li>
        <li>Overall package size needs to be small. Big graphics and sound are great until they take too long to
            download.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I'm aiming for a web app, with Typescript and p5. Eventually I want users to visit the webpage and start playing.

<section id="business-requirements">
    <h2>Business Requirements</h2>
    <p>I work full-time, so this is a hobby project.
    <ul>
        <li>Game is free to buy.</li>
        <li>Game is Open Source. I'd be amazed if someone started messing with it.</li>
        <li>I need to be conservative with art resources. I can hand draw some portraits and poses, but music and sound
            effects are beyond my ability and will cost me. I have some royalty-free assets available from Humble
            Bundles
            that I can
            reuse.
        </li>
        <li>If I ever try to host this game I need to be careful about the overall package size. Music and art take up a
            lot
            of room, especially for a web app.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="story">
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>I have the story planned out (if I ever get enough sequels) but I chose Torrin's Trial first.
    <ul>
        <li>A Tutorial can be worked in if the main character is a novice when it comes to combat. Torrin is a wanderer
            first and a priest second. Her Crusader allies are veterans who can teach her about strategy.
        </li>
        <li>Demons invade the desert. Crusaders enter to finish them off. Torrin joins the Crusaders. Relatively simple
            story: kill demons dead.
        </li>
        <li>I'm not a professional artist, so art resources are limited. Keeping the player's squad small and the enemy
            squad mindless lets me focus on conserving resources.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="headshot">
        <div class="headshot-text-left">
            Torrin lives in the Fell Desert, where elemental creatures dwell and the humans of the Western Kingdom
            rarely
            visit. She
            struggles as the only living water elemental as a hermit. Most are terrified of her control over the
            waterbed.
            Others
            want to drain her moisture for themselves. But the demonic abominations changed everyone's priorities
            when they
            ravaged
            the desert. Enter the human Crusaders, trying to finish the War of Man.

        <div class="headshot-text-right">
            Torrin found a friend in Sir Camil Willaahd, a Crusader who convinced her to seek solace in his patron
            deity. The fiery
            saboteur Birnam and the stoic statuesque Petra form a squad dedicated to stopping the demons once and
            for
            all. They are
            highly effective together, and yet the demons still stand.

    <div>
        One night, Torrin finishes her prayer deep within the Crusader base. Inspiration strikes: the way to destroy
        the demon
        remnants altogether. But her time is short: Sir Camil calls for aid! Demons have snuck past base defenses
        and are
        heading straight for her.

    <h2>Inspirations and comparison</h2>
    <section id="pathfinder-2">
        <h3>Pathfinder Second Edition</h3>
        <img src="../assets/PF2Logo.png" height="175" width="500" alt="Pathfinder Second Edition logo"/>
        <div>
            <p>Pathfinder is a table-top Role Playing Game that began as a spin-off of Dungeons & Dragons.
                Most players take the role of adventurers who use diplomacy, weapons and magic to talk to kings, conquer
                dungeons and handle greater threats. One player is the Game Master who crafts the world and narrates the
                adventure.</p>
            <p>The tactical system is mathematically balanced in a way that is easy to analyze. The designers have been
                pretty open about measuring the Time to Kill and the Team Action Economy.</p>
            <p>The team should spend their
                actions optimizing their attacks and stealing enemy actions. This way they can speed up their kills
                before the enemy can hurt them too much.</p>
            <p>There is also the four degrees of success. You can critically succeed if you beat the defender by 10 or
                more (using a 20 sided die.) You can critically fail if you miss by 10 or more. Critical success doubles
                damage. Critical Failure against a spell is very debilitating, usually taking the target out of the
                fight. This means minor buffs are extremely useful because they nudge you closer to that +10 or -10
                threshold.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Lessons learned</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Set up a critical threshold and four degrees of success</b> - I can avoid "save or suck" situations by
                adding some nuance. For example, spending resources could guarantee some kind of effect, even if it
                fails.
            </li>
            <li><b>3 actions per turn</b> - keep it simple so players don't have to think about action types. Instead,
                players focus on how to conserve and combine actions.
            </li>
            <li><b>Small buffs and debuffs matter</b> - a -1 may not seem like much until it nudges towards critical
                success and failure.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fire Emblem (2003)</h3>
        <img src="../assets/FireEmblem2003TitleScreen.png" height="160" width="240"/>
        <div>
            <p>In 2003, Nintendo began localizing the Japan-only tactical series known as Fire Emblem. The 7th game
                debuted in 2003 on the Game Boy Advance.</p>
            <p>You play as a tactician, but the stars of the show are the three lords, Lyn, Eliwood and Hector. They
                travel across the continent of Elibe, slowly discovering a plot to unleash a world of dragons across the
                world. The lords form an army and engage in Turn Based Strategy to defeat the madman Nergal and his army
                of not-quite-human Morphs.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Lessons learned</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Care about your teammates</b> - every unit in your army had their own personality. They had unique
                conversations with up to 5 teammates. They had unique death quotes! Powergamers argue endlessly about
                the strongest unit in terms of stats, utility, availability, and supports, by name. I can create a
                stronger appeal by infusing the team with personality.
            </li>
            <li><b>Villains can be personal</b> - Nergal, his plot, his plan, his methods. When I first played I was so
                entranced by the spectacle. It's only years later that I realized the many inconsistencies and tropes he
                falls prey to,
                but who cares? I'm already a fan.
            </li>
            <li><b>Desert Fantasy setting</b> - A few chapters take place in a desert covered by an endless sandstorm. The game
                briefly touches on it to explain what happened to the dragons from a war 1000 years ago. Another
                fascinating plot point that inspired this game's setting.
            </li>
            <li><b>Keep the math simple</b> - Your chance to hit, damage and critically hit can be calculated by hand. It's
                addition and subtraction. The weapon triangle adds a rock-paper-scissors element, but you know it in
                advance. Later in the game you can become so strong and so accurate you can mow down most foes except
                for That One Enemy. Simple math is simply predictable.
            </li>
