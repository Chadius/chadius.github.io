<h2>About me</h2>
<ul class="about-me">
    <li>I'm Chad, I work as a software engineer on the East Coast of the United States.</li>
    <li>I've been trying to make computer games since I was 10.</li>
    <li>I made an Turn-Based Strategy game, but it's old, and took several years, and was very difficult to play.</li>
    <li>Torrin's Trial is almost a year in the making. The plan is to release something by mid-October to mark the 1-year anniversary of development.</li>
    <li>This game will be free to play, at least until costs pile up.</li>
