  <p class="invert-in">This month's highlight is the Zoommaster 500. As you can see, its an extremely flexible vehicle that can fulfill many purposes:<br>
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fuel efficient: A pint of gas will get you across the country. Of course, there is a solar-powered battery that will go for a long time before.</li>
    <li>Low-altitude flight: Ever wanted to fly to the cape, then drive up and down the coast? The Zoommaster 500 can maintain its elevation for short distances.</li>
    <li>Compact: The Zoommaster 500 fits into a briefcase, so you can carry it on an airplane at a moment's notice (make sure to tell the agent about it though- it's sure to set off the metal detectors.)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Rating</h2>
  I'd give this 5 stars. Highly recommended...if you can afford it.
