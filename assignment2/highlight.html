    Monthly Highlight: The Zoommaster 500!
  </h1>
  <img src="http://lorempixel.com/400/400/transport/" alt="It's the Zoommaster 500!" class="centered rounded">
  <p>This month's highlight is the Zoommaster 500. As you can see, its an extremely flexible vehicle that can fulfill many purposes:<br>
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <li>
    <ul>Fuel efficient: A pint of gas will get you across the country. Of course, there is a solar-powered battery that will go for a long time before.</ul>
    <ul>Low-altitude flight: Ever wanted to fly to the cape, then drive up and down the coast? The Zoommaster 500 can maintain its elevation for short distances.</ul>
    <ul>Compact: The Zoommaster 500 fits into a briefcase, so you can carry it on an airplane at a moment's notice (make sure to tell the agent about it though- it's sure to set off the metal detectors.)</ul>
  </li>
  <h2>Rating</h2>
  I'd give this 5 stars. Highly recommended...if you can afford it.
