    Monthly Highlight: The Zoommaster 500!
  </p>
  <img src="http://lorempixel.com/400/400/transport/" alt="Transportation, It's the Zoommaster 500!" class="centered">
  <p>This month's highlight is the Zoommaster 500. As you can see, its an extremely flexible vehicle that can fulfill many purposes.<br>
  <br>
  Ever wanted to fly to the cape, then drive up and down the coast?. The Zoommaster 500 fits into a briefcase, so you can carry it on an airplane at a moment's notice (make sure to tell the agent about it though- it's sure to set off the metal detectors.)<br>
  <br>
  It's quite fuel efficient, too. A pint of gas will get you across the country. Of course, there is a solar-powered battery that will go for a long time before.<br>
  <br>
  I'd give this 5 stars. Highly recommended...if you can afford it.
