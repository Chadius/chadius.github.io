ABOVE AND BEYOND (10 POINTS)
Identify what you did for Above and Beyond. Provide any relevant HTML, CSS, Sass, or JavaScript line number(s) and explanation of what you did. How many points do you think this was worth, and why? You can do more than one thing if you want.

I wrote a JavaScript-based slideshow. Every 2 seconds it will advance to the next picture. Clicking one of the navigation buttons will manually control the pictures. Most of the code is in js/slideshow.js . I also added CSS animations in scss/_chad_styles.scss lines 140-148.

I used CSS3 variables in scss/_chad_styles.scss lines 4-22.

With these efforts, I am aiming for 98 points.
