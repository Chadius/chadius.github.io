ABOVE AND BEYOND (10 POINTS)
What did you do for your “above and beyond” requirement? How many points do you think this was worth and why?

I have made 7 points of credit.

- CSS uses a "mobile-first" approach by defining mobile dimensions first and then using media queries to apply tablet and desktop dimensions to the elements.
- The pages use tablet and desktop dimensions with breakpoints at widths of 750 and 1000 pixels.
- I used a google font, Roberto. (See css/responsive-flexbox.css lines 10-17 and index.html line 8)
- Every picture has a large and small version, using the <picture> tag.
- The map on index.html actually links to Google Maps
