    Did you know ground up cauliflower can make a creamy sauce? Add some lemon and garlic and you have alfredo sauce!

    <span class="dish">Mixed Fruit and Nut salad</span>
    <span class="price">$10</span>
    Oh? You think salad isn't a main course? Have you tried it with cashews, boiled carrots, apples, cranberries, blueberries, almonds, fried chickpeas and 1/3 a pound of spinach over a vinagrette dressing? Probably not!
    Mix and match as many ingredients as you want.
