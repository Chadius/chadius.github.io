  </aside>
	<div>
	  <section>
			<img src="./SampleImage.png" alt="Vegetable Samosas" class="centered" width="400" height="400">
	    <span class="food-course">Appetizer</span>
	    <span class="dish">Vegetable Samosas(2)</span>
	    <span class="price">$5</span>
	    This savory fried dish is filled with potatoes, peas and a little bit of pepper for that extra kick!

			<img src="./SampleImage.png" alt="Vegan Alfredo with Penne and Broccoli" class="centered" width="400" height="400">
	    <span class="food-course">Main Course #1</span>
	    <span class="dish">Vegan Alfredo with Penne and Broccoli</span>
	    <span class="price">$8-10</span>
	    Did you know ground up cauliflower can make a creamy sauce? Add some lemon and garlic and you have alfredo sauce!
	    A twist of a classic dish. Comes with a breadstick and cashews.
	    Add buttermilk tofu for $2 more
	  </section>
	  <section>
			<img src="./SampleImage.png" alt="Mixed Fruit and Nut Salad" class="centered" width="400" height="400">
	    <span class="food-course">Main Course #2</span>
	    <span class="dish">Mixed Fruit and Nut salad</span>
	    <span class="price">$10</span>
	    Oh? You think salad isn't a main course? Have you tried it with cashews, boiled carrots, apples, cranberries, blueberries, almonds, fried chickpeas and 1/3 a pound of spinach over a vinagrette dressing? Probably not!
	    Mix and match as many ingredients as you want.
