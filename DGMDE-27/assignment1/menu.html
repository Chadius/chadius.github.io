Every Monday, we change the menu so you don't have to! Here's what we are offering this week:

Appetizer
Vegetable Samosas(2)

This savory fried dish is filled with potatoes, peas and a little bit of pepper for that extra kick!

Main Course #1
Penne Alfredo with Broccoli
$8-10
Did you know ground up cauliflower can make a creamy sauce? Add some lemon and garlic and you have alfredo sauce!
A twist of a classic dish. Comes with a breadstick and cashews.
Add buttermilk tofu for $2 more

FOOD3
Main Course #2
Fruit and Nut salad
$10
Oh? You think salad isn't a main course? Have you tried it with cashews, boiled carrots, apples, cranberries, blueberries, almonds, fried chickpeas and 1/3 a pound of spinach over a vinagrette dressing? Probably not!
Mix and match as many ingredients as you want.

Using Almond or Soy milk as a base (your choice!) We top this with some sweet cinnamon.
Kale is optional (and free.)
